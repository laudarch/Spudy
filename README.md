Spudy "Speed Study!"
=====

The purpose Spudy is to help students(or anyone who needs to read extensively) learn their information quickly while retaining high levels of comprehension. It utilizes several modern api's to convert images of textbook/book pages to plain text which is then displayed to the user at an adjustable reading rate of up to 800 words per minute. By displaying one word at a time, the user doesnt have to move his or her eyes and interprets the words as pictures rather than letter-by-letter, allowing for much faster reading. We strongly believe that such a tool is absolutely essential for students who have limited time to cover very large amounts of material on a day-to-day basis. The expansion potential for such an app is unbounded.
